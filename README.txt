The fully working last update of the project is called : "MindMapProject"
Untouched backups : "MindMapProject - Copy" and "MindMapProject - Copy 2"
IdeaMapper I'm not sure, it's pulled from a forked GitHub and then was updated locally here from MindMapProject - Copy

MindMapFinal, as I remember is edited.

mindmap_project is the original project working on Firebase only. For testing reasons
